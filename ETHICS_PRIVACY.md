# Ethics & Privacy Specification
## Safety Detection System

### Purpose & Scope
This system is designed to enhance public safety by detecting potentially risky situations in real-time while maintaining strict privacy protections. The system operates on the principle of "privacy by design" and focuses on situational awareness rather than individual identification.

### Core Privacy Principles

#### 1. No Personal Identification
- **No face recognition**: The system does not perform facial recognition or store facial biometric data
- **No identity tracking**: Person tracking is limited to temporary session IDs that are not linked to personal identity
- **Anonymized data**: All stored data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify individuals

#### 2. Data Minimization
- **Event-based storage**: Only clips of detected events are stored, not continuous video
- **Short retention**: Event clips are automatically deleted after 30 days unless flagged for investigation
- **Metadata only**: Long-term storage consists only of anonymized metadata (counts, locations, times)

#### 3. Data Protection Measures
- **Face blurring**: All stored clips have faces automatically blurred using computer vision
- **Secure storage**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access controls**: Strict role-based access controls for all system components

### Data Handling

#### What We Store
- **Event clips**: 6-10 second video clips of detected incidents (faces blurred)
- **Metadata**: Camera ID, zone, timestamp, event type, confidence scores
- **Aggregate statistics**: Gender distribution counts, hotspot analytics
- **System logs**: Technical logs for debugging and system monitoring

#### What We DON'T Store
- **Continuous video streams**: No persistent video recording
- **Personal identifiers**: No names, faces, or identifying information
- **Biometric data**: No facial recognition or biometric templates
- **Individual tracking history**: No cross-session person tracking

### Retention Policy
- **Event clips**: 30 days maximum, then automatic deletion
- **Metadata**: 1 year for analytics, then anonymized aggregation only
- **System logs**: 90 days for technical debugging
- **Hotspot data**: Indefinite (anonymized location and time patterns only)

### Bias Control & Fairness
- **Probabilistic gender estimation**: All gender classifications include confidence scores
- **Subgroup monitoring**: Performance metrics tracked across different demographic groups
- **Human oversight**: All alerts require human review before action
- **Transparency**: Confidence scores and reasoning provided for all decisions

### Legal & Compliance
- **Purpose limitation**: Data used only for stated safety purposes
- **Lawful basis**: Public safety and legitimate interest in crime prevention
- **Data subject rights**: Right to access, rectification, and erasure (where applicable)
- **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all data access and processing activities

### Human-in-the-Loop Requirements
- **Alert review**: All automated alerts require human verification
- **Escalation protocols**: Clear procedures for handling different alert types
- **Operator training**: Comprehensive training on bias awareness and privacy protection
- **Regular audits**: Quarterly reviews of system performance and privacy compliance

### Technical Safeguards
- **On-premises processing**: All video processing happens locally, no cloud transmission
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Network security**: Isolated network segments for video processing
- **Access logging**: Complete audit trail of all system access

### Incident Response
- **Data breach procedures**: Immediate notification and containment protocols
- **Privacy impact assessment**: Regular reviews of privacy implications
- **Stakeholder communication**: Clear communication with affected parties
- **Regulatory reporting**: Compliance with local data protection regulations

### Review & Updates
This specification will be reviewed quarterly and updated as needed to reflect:
- Changes in technology capabilities
- Updates to privacy regulations
- Lessons learned from system operation
- Stakeholder feedback and concerns
